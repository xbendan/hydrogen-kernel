 * AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that was approved by the National
 * Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. It is based on the
 * Rijndael algorithm developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Vincent Rijmen
 * and Joan Daemen. AES is a block cipher that encrypts data in 128-bit blocks.
 * It supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. AES is widely used in
 * commercial applications and is considered to be secure.
